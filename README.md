# Attendance-Using-Mobile-Application-2017-2018-
It was mobile app and website for student attendance. 

It was a mobile application used to take attendance in universities and compatible with both mobile and website. The name of app was Web Register. It saves time and paper work. It helps to contact mentors and students, regarding their problems and can make appointment with mentors on appropriate date and time. This application was made on AppyPie, a online platform where you can make free websites, android and iOS applications. AppyPie is like WordPress. Its database was made on google firebase. But after project completion we never use firebase 2018 thus our google firebase removed permission to access database.
